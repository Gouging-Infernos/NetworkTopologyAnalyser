# ðŸš€ Network Topology Analyser

A powerful tool for discovering, analyzing, and visualizing network topologies in real-time. This application scans your local network, identifies connected devices, and generates an interactive, graphical map of the network structure.

## ## About The Project

In modern networking, understanding the layout and interconnections of devices is crucial for management, security, and troubleshooting. The Network Topology Analyser automates this process. It uses network scanning protocols to discover devices like routers, switches, servers, and clients, and then renders the relationships between them in an intuitive and interactive graph.

This tool is designed for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and tech enthusiasts who need a quick and clear overview of a network's architecture.

## âœ¨ Essential Features to build

* **Automatic Network Discovery:** Scans the network to find active hosts and devices without prior configuration.
* **Device Identification:** Predicts device types (e.g., router, switch, printer, PC) based on network signatures and open ports.
* **Interactive Graphical Visualization:** Renders the network map using a dynamic graph. You can drag, zoom, and click on nodes for more information.
* **Detailed Node Information:** Click on any device in the graph to view its IP address, MAC address, open ports, and predicted role.
* **Export Topology:** Save the current network map as a PNG image or a JSON file for documentation and later analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

This project needs to be built with a combination of powerful technologies for network analysis and data visualization:

* **Backend & Discovery Engine:** Python (using libraries like Scapy & Nmap)
* **Visualization Frontend:** (Any python or Javascript libraries are welcome)
